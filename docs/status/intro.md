# 🚦 Status Module

## 📘 Introduction

In **Cluster v2**, we introduced a powerful **Dynamic Status Module**. Unlike **Cluster v1**, where statuses were hardcoded per module, v2 allows teams to **create and manage statuses dynamically**, giving more flexibility and customization for each organization.

### 🧠 Where Can You Use It?

* From the **centralized Status module UI** (Settings)
* Inline in **status dropdowns** for modules like Lead, Ticket, Interview, etc.
