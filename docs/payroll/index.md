# Payroll Setup

The Payroll module allows you to configure salary components for your organization.

Before running payroll:
- You must **create a custom setup**, or  
- **Select a standard payroll template**.

Each setup includes:
- **Earnings** like Basic, HRA, Bonus  
- **Deductions** like PF, Professional Tax  
- **Calculated values** like Total, Gross  

> ⚠️ Once setup is completed, it can only be updated — not recreated.
